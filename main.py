# As of April 11, 2024 I've been coding python for about a year on and off, but I wanted to start over
# and stay consistent for a long time so I am starting from the beginning
# print("Hello World!")

print("Hello my name is Dexter Mack, I am a first-year statistics student at Santa Monica College learning python")

# This is string concatenation
# String is a simple data structure
